task.ps1 - creates a scheduled task that runs every 5 minutes. Task jumps into the user's context and runs idlecheck.ps1 to check idle status. Outputs timespan to output.txt. psrun.vbs is needed to keep the Powershell window completely invisible to the user.

monitor.ps1 - updates the IdleTime UDF with 1 of 3 values - Logged Off, Active, or Idle - based on the existence of explorer.exe and the contents of output.txt.

If you're having trouble saving the script or the monitor or the monitoring policy, try removing all #COMMENTS. For some reason Datto doesn't interpret them very well...
